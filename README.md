# My reading list
Where I get most of my regular information from organized by format and topic. I generally spend the most time on newsletters, followed by individual blogs, and podcasts only when I drive or ride transit. There are many other great sources of information I have listened to over the years, but these are the things I remember at least skimming relatively recently.
